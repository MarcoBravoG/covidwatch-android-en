# CovidWatch Android POC
Android POC for www.covid-watch.org

This repository is focused on the implementation of the Android version of the COVID Watch app. Our goals are to:
- Allow users to anonymously record interactions with others using the [TCN Protocol](https://github.com/TCNCoalition/tcn-client-android)
- Notify users if someone they've interacted with in the past 2 weeks indicates they've tested positive for COVID-19 (again, anonymously!)
- Offer a seamless UX to complete all of the above!

The current version of the Figma we're working towards: https://www.figma.com/file/0uL6s79o21jwUFZz16Dr8b/Covid-Watch---App-v1.8?node-id=0%3A1

### Looking to contribute?

- Pull a copy of the `develop` branch to get the latest version of the code
- Run on your own device to play with the UX. If you have any feedback/find any problems, create an issue!
- If you find a solution to an existing issue create a branch and a PR to `develop`. Look at https://github.com/orgs/covid19risk/projects/1 for existing issues
